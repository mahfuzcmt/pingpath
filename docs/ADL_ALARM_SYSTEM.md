# ADL Moto Viewer — alarm & notification system (recon 2026-09-16)

Captured from the ADL demo account with `scripts/explore_adl_alarms.js` and
`scripts/explore_adl_alarms2.js` (screenshots in `adl_screenshots/alarm*.png`,
page text in `alarm_recon.json` / `alarm2_recon.json`). ADL is a white-label of
the gpsen platform ("GPSBot" assistant, `main.html#/home/...` hash routes).
